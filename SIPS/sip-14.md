## Context of changes to SIP-13
The main aims of [SIP-13](https://gov.sirenmarkets.com/t/sip-13-aqua-minimal-viable-dao-mvd/239/5) were to start co-creating with working groups and community members of SI community.

After hearing community feedback from Swiss Miss, we recognize that the AquaDAO may have been too confusing for our commmunity to follow. The DAO aspect can be confusing as we are yet to migrate towards Snapshot voting and the funding of the different categories had some improvements areas.

Hence the rebranding of AquaDAO to Siren Grants.

We will still be operating with regular Siren Community calls to coordinate working groups similar to [IndexCoop](https://gov.indexcoop.com) as we would like model our community similar to this approach.  

## What is the Siren Grants Program

In order to promote a more vibrant community, the Siren Grants Program is proposed to push forward the decentralized development of the protocol. The goal is to provide support to projects seeking to further the development and decentralization, therefore grants will be provided to the following categories:

- Usability
- Community
- Developer Tooling
- Request for Proposal (RFP)

These being the core focus, there should also be two categories as a catch-all, one is for Siren Foundation defined projects or Request for Proposals (RFPs) as they are formally known in the non-degen world, the other is simply for Others. The latter being a category for community driven solutions that do not fit in the standard categories. 

## What are the goals for the categories?

In order to better define the focus areas.. please keep reading..
  
* **Usability**: Options by definition are complex financial instruments that are understood by advanced degens. A core factor in ensuring maximum decentralization is enabling usability of the protocol. This may be defined by software abstraction layers which enable greater utility of the application such as [Ribbon Finance](https://www.ribbon.finance) that bring options to a broader audience by simplifying the user experience.
* **Community**: The SIREN community will be growing and are looking for all typed of skilled contributors to add the ecosystem. From creative design, content creation, regular Discord and Telegram discussions to being the best SIREN sea meme creators, we welcome all to apply. This is modelled off the incentives and working group model that [IndexCoop](https://gov.indexcoop.com) and [BanklessDao](https://www.bankless.community) have created compelling communities. 
* **Developer Tooling**: Developer tools are important in order to enable greater innovation on Siren Protocol. Developer tools may be comprised of data analytics tools, command line interface tools, or other software based tooling that enables greater exploration and innovation on Siren Protocol.

## Siren Grants Program Work Flow

The Siren Grants Program will follow the SIP process as all proposals must go through a vote. 
[ WIP ] -> [ PROPOSED ] -> [ APPROVED ] -> [ IMPLEMENTED ] X [ REJECTED ] 

Each status change is requested by the grants author and reviewed by the SIP
editors. Use a pull request to update the status. Please include a link to where
people should continue discussing your SIP. The SIP editors will process these
requests as per the conditions below.

* **Work in progress (WIP)** -- Once the champion has asked the SIREN community
  whether an idea has any chance of support, they will write a draft SIP as a
[pull request]. Consider including an implementation if this will aid people in
studying the SIP.
* **Proposed** If agreeable, SIP editor will assign the SIP a number (generally
  the issue or PR number related to the SIP) and merge your pull request. The
SIP editor will not unreasonably deny an SIP. Proposed SIPs will be discussed on
governance calls and in Discord. If there is a reasonable level of consensus
around the change on the governance call the change will be moved to approved.
If the change is contentious a vote of token holders may be held to resolve the
issue or approval may be delayed until consensus is reached.
* **Approved** -- This SIP has passed community governance and is now being
  prioritised for development.
  
* **Implemented** -- This SIP has been implemented and deployed to mainnet.

* **Rejected** -- This SIP has failed to reach community consensus.
